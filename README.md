glo
===

A light (maybe medium weight) but powerful implementation of the git-flow development pattern.

Currently stable but still in alpha.

Add this repo location to your path and run 'glo help' - that should get you going.
Some commands need the glo config file in your home dir. Create a .gloconfig file and add the line:
GLO_USERNAME=(your username)
to it.

Please log any feedback or bugs on github!
